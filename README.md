# Task5-Elevate-labs

I successfully installed and configured Wireshark on my system to monitor network traffic on the active interface.

I initiated packet capture sessions and monitored live network traffic flowing through my network interface.

I generated network traffic by performing ping operations to google.com and facebook.com to create ICMP packets.

I captured and analyzed over 300 network packets during extended monitoring sessions lasting several minutes.

I applied protocol filters to isolate and examine specific traffic types including ICMP, TCP, UDP, and DNS protocols.

I identified and documented 5 different network protocols (ICMP, TCP, UDP, DNS, ARP) with detailed packet analysis.

I measured network performance metrics including latency, packet loss, and response times for different destinations.

I documented my findings with screenshots and prepared comprehensive analysis reports for export as .pcap files.
